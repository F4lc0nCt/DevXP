# DevXP
Retrieve Developer XP from VCS

https://github.com/F4lc0nCt/devxp

## Goal
The goal of this module is to analyse a VCS repository. Currently, the only
VCS tool supported is Git.

The idea of this project is based on the work of Adam Tornhill: "Your Code as a Crime" and the tool CodeScene.
This project gives the possibilities to the users to change parameters concerning the experience of the developer.

## Requirements
This module was developed with Python 3.8.0. I decided to avoid using external libraries to allow this code
to be run in offline environments.
